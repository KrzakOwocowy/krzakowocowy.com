        <h3>Negative major scale theory</h3>
        <p>Taking a major scale tonality (types of chords you can build in a major scale) and changing every chord function</p>
        <p>Major becomes minor and vice versa, diminished becomes augumented</p>
        <p>Then starting from the first note we build chords, to maintain a 7 note scale we need to change notes so that they have the same accidental as the notes in chords before it</p>

        <p>Here are some functional chords we can use in this scale:</p>
        <p>Other than the naturally occuring 7 chords we can also make the V chord major for a more stable resolution, or use one of the chords we had to alter previously</p>
