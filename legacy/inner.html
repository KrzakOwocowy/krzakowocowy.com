        <h3>Reflections on my inner self, Very Interesting People and the impact of her</h3>
        <p>
            Part I - The aftermath
        </p>
        <p>
            She is dead, her remaining influence on the physical world is marginal - a few objects and the restructuring of my congenital muscle memory right hand plucking technique by the reterritorialization of said muslces into the instrument of desire - those influences could as well be made by someone from their grave. She therefore became a fanged noumnemon, the very first Very Uninteresting Person
        </p>
        <p>
            Part II - Very Interesting People
        </p>
        <p>
            Very Interesting People are the interfaces for communication with the subconcious, and the only consistent method of thinking in my brain. They are based on physical beings, but are increasingly detached from them with time. The only (so far) Very Uninteresting Person is also an interface for the communication with the subconcious, but explicitly for evoking negative thoughts and emotions.

            Part III - The drive for change
        </p>
        <p>
            Most of my actions are driven by a desire to "please" one of the VIP's, and become more like them. VIP's physical manifestation cast a marginal or inconsequential (sometimes non-existent) influence on my thinking, therefore the beings that rule me and drive me to change are not other beings but fanged noumena, creations of my own mind, representations of my desires and lacks. I'm ultimately driven to become what <i> I </i> want to become, other people have a near zero influence.
        </p>
        <p>
            Part IV - The realisation
        </p>
        <p>
            The first VIP's in my memory started around my childhood and were fictional characters, over time they were replaced by "real people". Therefore i need to confront this question: Should I commit to the death of those physical versions of VIP, or at least the separation of the noumena into a separate identities, or is it better to keep the delusion of talking to real people to preserve my humanity
